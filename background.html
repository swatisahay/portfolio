            <p>I am engineering professional with 5+ years of industry experience and ISTQB(International software testing qualification board) certified foundation level software tester</p>
            <p>My career encompasses an extensive experience working with multinational companies like Emerson electric, General Electric in India, and an engineering degree in electrical & electronics.</p>
            <p>During my work at Emerson, I was involved in end to end process of building electrical rotating machines, including driving requirement clarification, documentation, designing prototypes, project management, quality assurance and Testing etc. During my work I also provided technical training and manufacturing guidance to the on-the floor employees</p>
            <p>I also contributed to other aspects of project management including marketing, driving customer requirement/expectations, cost evaluation, product ISO certification and training local technicians amongst others.</p>
            <p>Last, I worked on a key project for General Electric which involved evaluating and building migration strategy and plan for upgrading existing locomotives traction motor model to the most suitable models. For the project, I led the compatibility design study for various upgradable models and documented various choices with a proposed solution. I also built the strategy for migration which was later approved and used by General Electric for driving successful migration.</p>
